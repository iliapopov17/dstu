**THIS TOOL WILL BE REWRITTEN COMPLETELY TO WORK LOCALLY**

> Phyloki simplifies phylogenetic tree creation in microbiology and virology by facilitating sequence downloads from NCBI GenBank using accession numbers. It also reinstates organism names in trees constructed with IQ-TREE, retrieves host information about microorganisms, and prepares annotation datasets for further visualization in iTOL.

Phyloki allows easy and simple annotation of phylogenetic trees. See the examples above:
- The best tree contains information about the hosts from which the virus was isolated and the full names of the viruses.
- The so-so tree contains the same information, but is colour annotated with randomly generated colours.
- The worst tree contains only accession numbers on its leaves.

## Features
### Sequence Downloading
- Facilitates the retrieval of sequences from NCBI GenBank using specified accession numbers.
### Organism Name Reintegration
- Enhances IQ-TREE constructed trees by replacing accession numbers with the corresponding organism names for clarity and context.
### Host Information Retrieval
- Gathers host data for each microorganism, including the host's taxonomic order.
### Annotation Dataset Preparation for iTOL
- Utilizes the collected host information to prepare detailed annotation datasets, optimizing visualization in iTOL.

## Installation

> I plan to finish all the features of this tool and publish it to `conda` oneday!

```bash
git clone git@github.com:iliapopov17/phyloki.git && cd phyloki
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage Guide
- Demonstrational python notebook is available in `demo.ipynb` file
- Demonstrational data is available in `demo_data` folder

Demonstrational data is based on the recent paper about identifying novel hantavirus in bats
